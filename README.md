## More about the project

In the april I created [Gradely 1](https://gradelyapp.com/gradely1) because there are no Grade Calculator apps, that stores the grades in the cloud.
Gradely 1's backend server is Firebase. Firebase is ok, but there are many limits when you don't buy the paid plan. Furthermore the Firebase libary is very big, Firebase took the half of the app size and that's very bad.

Gradely 2 is based on [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io). Appwrite is a selfhosted, opensource backend server and very lightweight. Gradely 2's size is 50% smaller then Gradely 1. Furthermore there are no write, get, delete limits.
